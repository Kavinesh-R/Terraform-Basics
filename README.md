# Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It enables users to define, provision, and manage infrastructure resources using a declarative configuration language. With Terraform, infrastructure is represented as code, and the desired state of the infrastructure is described in configuration files.

## Getting Started with Terraform

To use Terraform:
<ol>

<li> Install Terraform on your system. You can download it from the official website: https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html </li> <br/>

 <li>   Set up your cloud provider credentials (e.g., AWS, Azure) to access and manage resources. </li> <br/>

 <li>   Create a Terraform configuration file (e.g., main.tf) and define your desired infrastructure resources and their configurations. </li> <br/>

  <li>  Run terraform init in the directory containing your Terraform configuration to initialize Terraform. </li> <br/>

  <li> Use terraform plan to see the execution plan and review the proposed changes.</li> <br/>

  <li>  Apply the changes using `terraform apply` to create and manage the infrastructure resources as per the configuration.</li> <br/>

  <li>  To destroy the resources when no longer needed, use ``terraform destroy`. </li> <br/>

  </ol>
